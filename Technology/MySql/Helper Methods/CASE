In MySQL, the CASE statement is a conditional expression used to perform conditional logic in SQL queries. It is similar to the IF-THEN-ELSE logic in programming languages. The CASE statement allows you to evaluate conditions and return a value based on the first condition that evaluates to TRUE.
	
	Syntax
		There are two forms of the CASE statement in MySQL:

			1. Simple CASE
				CASE expression
				    WHEN value1 THEN result1
				    WHEN value2 THEN result2
				    ...
				    ELSE default_result
				END


				- expression: The value or column to evaluate.

				- WHEN value THEN result: If expression matches value, return result.

				- ELSE default_result: If no condition matches, return default_result.

			2. Searched CASE
				CASE
				    WHEN condition1 THEN result1
				    WHEN condition2 THEN result2
				    ...
				    ELSE default_result
				END

				- WHEN condition THEN result: If condition evaluates to TRUE, return result.

				- ELSE default_result: If no condition is TRUE, return default_result.

Examples
	Table: employees
	id	name	 	salary
	1	John Doe	60000
	2	Jane Smith	45000
	3	Alice Lee	80000


1. Simple CASE Example
	
	SELECT name, salary,
    CASE
        WHEN salary < 50000 THEN 'Low'
        WHEN salary BETWEEN 50000 AND 70000 THEN 'Medium'
        ELSE 'High'
    END AS salary_category
	FROM employees;

	Output: 
		name		salary	salary_category
		John Doe	60000	Medium
		Jane Smith	45000	Low
		Alice Lee	80000	High

2. Searched CASE Example

	SELECT name, salary,
    CASE
        WHEN salary < 50000 THEN 'Low'
        WHEN salary BETWEEN 50000 AND 70000 THEN 'Medium'
        WHEN salary > 70000 THEN 'High'
        ELSE 'Unknown'
    END AS salary_category
	FROM employees;

	Output:
		name		salary	salary_category
		John Doe	60000	Medium
		Jane Smith	45000	Low
		Alice Lee	80000	High


3. Using CASE in an UPDATE Statement
	
	Update employees
	set salary_category = 
	CASE
		WHEN salary < 50000 THEN 'low'
		WHEN salary between 50000 and 70000 THEN 'medium'
		ELSE 'High'
		END;

4. Using CASE in an ORDER BY Clause
	
	SELECT name, salary
	FROM employees
	ORDER BY 
		CASE WHEN salary < 50000 THEN 1
        WHEN salary BETWEEN 50000 AND 70000 THEN 2
        ELSE 3
    END;


    Output:
	name		salary
	Jane Smith	45000
	John Doe	60000
	Alice Lee	80000


	Explanation: Employees are sorted by salary category (Low, Medium, High).

Key Notes

	1. Order of Evaluation: The CASE statement evaluates conditions in the order they are written. Once a condition evaluates to TRUE, the corresponding result is returned, and no further conditions are checked.

	2. ELSE Clause: The ELSE clause is optional. If no condition matches and there is no ELSE clause, the result is NULL.

	3. Data Types: All results in a CASE statement must be of the same or compatible data types.
