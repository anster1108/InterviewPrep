In MySQL, the ORDER BY clause is used to sort the result set of a query in ascending or descending order based on one or more columns. By default, ORDER BY sorts in ascending order (ASC). You can specify descending order using DESC.

Syntax
	SELECT column1, column2, ...
	FROM table_name
	ORDER BY column1 [ASC|DESC], column2 [ASC|DESC], ...;

	- column1, column2, ...: The columns to sort by.

	- ASC: Sorts in ascending order (default).

	- DESC: Sorts in descending order.

Examples
	Table: employees
	
	id		name			salary		department
	1		John Doe		60000		Sales
	2		Jane Smith		45000		HR
	3		Alice Lee		80000		Sales
	4		Bob Johnson		55000		IT


1. Sort by a Single Column (Ascending Order)
	Sort employees by their name in ascending order.

	Query : SELECT name, salary FROM employees
			ORDER BY name ASC;


	Output:

		name			salary
		Alice Lee		80000
		Bob Johnson		55000
		Jane Smith		45000
		John Doe		60000
	
	Explanation: The result is sorted alphabetically by name.


2. Sort by a Single Column (Descending Order)
	Sort employees by their salary in descending order.

	Query : SELECT name, salary FROM employees
			ORDER BY salary DESC;

	Output:

		name		salary
		Alice Lee	80000
		John Doe	60000
		Bob Johnson	55000
		Jane Smith	45000

	Explanation: The result is sorted by salary from highest to lowest.


3. Sort by Multiple Columns
	Sort employees by department in ascending order and then by salary in descending order.

	Query :  SELECT name, department, salary FROM employees
			 ORDER BY department ASC, salary DESC;

	Output:

		name		department	salary
		Jane Smith	HR			45000
		Bob Johnson	IT			55000
		Alice Lee	Sales		80000
		John Doe	Sales		60000

	
	Explanation:
		- First, the result is sorted by department in ascending order.

		- Within each department, employees are sorted by salary in descending order.

4. Sort by Column Position
	Sort employees by the second column (salary) in ascending order.

	Query : SELECT name, salary FROM employees
			ORDER BY 2 DESC;

	Output:

		name		salary
		Alice Lee	80000
		John Doe	60000
		Bob Johnson	55000
		Jane Smith	45000

	Explanation: The 2 in ORDER BY 2 refers to the second column in the SELECT list (salary).

5. Sort with NULL Values
	Sort employees by email in ascending order, with NULL values appearing last.

	Query : SELECT name, email FROM employees
			ORDER BY email IS NULL, email ASC;


		Output:

		name			email
		Alice Lee		alice@example.com
		John Doe		john@example.com
		Jane Smith		NULL


	Explanation:

		- email IS NULL evaluates to 1 for NULL values and 0 for non-NULL values.

		- Rows are sorted first by email IS NULL (placing NULL values last) and then by email in ascending order.


Key Notes

	1. Default Order: If no order is specified (ASC or DESC), the result is sorted in ascending order.

	2. Multiple Columns: You can sort by multiple columns by separating them with commas.

	3. Column Position: You can use column positions (e.g., ORDER BY 2) instead of column names.

	4. NULL Handling: By default, NULL values are treated as the lowest possible values in ascending order and the highest in descending order.
