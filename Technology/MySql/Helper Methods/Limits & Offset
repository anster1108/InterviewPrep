In MySQL, the LIMIT and OFFSET clauses are used to control the number of rows returned by a query and to skip a specified number of rows, respectively. These clauses are particularly useful for pagination or when you only need a subset of rows from a large result set.

Syntax : SELECT column1, column2, ...
			FROM table_name
			LIMIT number_of_rows OFFSET offset_value;

		- LIMIT number_of_rows: Specifies the maximum number of rows to return.

		- OFFSET offset_value: Specifies the number of rows to skip before starting to return rows.

Alternatively, you can use the shorthand syntax:
	SELECT column1, column2, ...
	FROM table_name
	LIMIT offset_value, number_of_rows;

	- offset_value: The number of rows to skip.

	- number_of_rows: The maximum number of rows to return.

Examples
	Table: employees
		id	name			salary	department
		1	John Doe		60000	Sales
		2	Jane Smith		45000	HR
		3	Alice Lee		80000	Sales
		4	Bob Johnson		55000	IT
		5	Charlie Brown	70000	IT
		6	David White		48000	HR
		7	Eve Black		90000	Sales


1. Basic LIMIT : Retrieve the first 3 rows from the employees table.

	Query : SELECT name, salary FROM employees LIMIT 3;

	Output:
		name		salary
		John Doe	60000
		Jane Smith	45000
		Alice Lee	80000

Explanation: The query returns the first 3 rows from the table.

2. LIMIT with OFFSET
	Retrieve rows 4 to 6 from the employees table.

	Query : SELECT name, salary FROM employees LIMIT 3 OFFSET 3;

	Output:
		name			salary
		Bob Johnson		55000
		Charlie Brown	70000
		David White		48000

	Explanation:
		OFFSET 3 skips the first 3 rows.

		LIMIT 3 returns the next 3 rows.

3. Shorthand Syntax
	Retrieve rows 4 to 6 using the shorthand syntax.

	Query : SELECT name, salary FROM employees LIMIT 3, 3;

	Output:
		name			salary
		Bob Johnson		55000
		Charlie Brown	70000
		David White		48000

	Explaination : LIMIT 3, 3 is equivalent to LIMIT 3 OFFSET 3.

4. Pagination Example
	Retrieve the second page of results (rows 4 to 6) for a paginated display.

	Query : SELECT name, salary FROM employees LIMIT 3 OFFSET 3;

	Output:
		name			salary
		Bob Johnson		55000
		Charlie Brown	70000
		David White		48000

	Explaination : This is useful for displaying data in chunks (e.g., 3 rows per page).

5. LIMIT with ORDER BY
	Retrieve the top 3 highest-paid employees

	Query : SELECT name, salary FROM employees
			ORDER BY salary DESC LIMIT 3;

	Output :

		name			salary
		Eve Black		90000
		Alice Lee		80000
		Charlie Brown	70000

	Explanation:

		- The query first sorts the rows by salary in descending order.

		- Then, it returns the top 3 rows.

Key Notes
	LIMIT: 
		- Controls the number of rows returned.

		- If the number of rows requested exceeds the available rows, all remaining rows are returned.

	OFFSET: 
		- Skips a specified number of rows before returning results.

		- Useful for pagination or skipping unwanted rows.

	Order Matters: 
		- Always use ORDER BY with LIMIT and OFFSET to ensure consistent results, especially in pagination.

	Performance: 
		- Using LIMIT and OFFSET on large tables can be slow if the OFFSET value is large, as MySQL must scan and skip many rows.


*** 
	LIMIT with OFFSET : If the OFFSET value skips all available rows, MySQL returns an empty result set.

		Query :  SELECT name, salary FROM employees LIMIT 3 OFFSET 10;

		Output : Empty table
