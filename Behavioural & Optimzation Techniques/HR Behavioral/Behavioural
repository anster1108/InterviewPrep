------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q. How are you doing?

1. Start With a Personal Connection
Proper research is essential. If you know something about the recruiter’s interests, you can personalize your response. For example, if you discover through LinkedIn or a Youtube or Instagram or a casual conversation that your interviewer is an avid runner, you can say something like:

“I’m doing well, actually! I’ve been training for a marathon, so it’s been a busy but exciting time.”

This approach not only answers the question but also builds an instant connection. The recruiter will remember you as the candidate who took the time to find a common ground.

2. Don’t go overboard: Don’t start talking them through your CV or skills that you’ve been learning, that is a bit too extra, this is about giving them a taste of your personality while, softly selling you as a cultural fit.

3. Highlight softskills: Whilst this is not the place to talk about concrete technical skills, this is definitely a question where you can subtly sell your soft skills like resilience and adaptability

4. Always ask the question back! And don’t be like, I’m fine thanks. Big no!

Here’s a simple sample answer that does all that, using the example earlier 🤩⬇️:

“I’m doing great, thanks! I’ve recently started running and have resolved to prepare for a marathon within the next 90 days, so that’s been keeping me on my toes — both literally and figuratively! It’s been challenging since I haven’t run before but it definitely has made me much resilient and adaptable. How about you?, How’s your week been?”

Well, this is just the tip of the interviewing iceberg and there’s a lot ahead.

Response 1 (Friendly & Engaging)
"I'm doing great, thank you for asking! It’s been an exciting week—lots of learning and growth, which I always enjoy. I’m really looking forward to this conversation and getting to know more about the team. How about you? How’s your day going?"

Response 2 (Energetic & Adaptive)
"I’m doing well! I had a productive morning, so I’m coming into this conversation with a lot of positive energy. Interviews can be a mix of excitement and nerves, but I love opportunities like this to connect and learn. How about you? How’s your day treating you?"

Response 3 (Relaxed & Personable)
"I’m doing well, thanks! I’ve been keeping busy, but I always enjoy meeting new people and having great conversations like this. Excited to be here and learn more about the role and team. How about yourself? How’s your day going so far?"
